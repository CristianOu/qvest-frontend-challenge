# qvest-frontend-challenge

A few notes I would like to mention before looking at the code:

- I decided to keep to scss files in the same folder with their connected component just so not to over-complicate the code structure. Usually, a sass 7-1 pattern is more practical when it comes about to write cleaner code and it is more efficient.

- I have not implemented the 'feature' which is in the top-right corner of the page (the one that displays the number of days left until the next task is open) because I am not completely sure what are the variables that modify this. Initially, I thought it is the time left until the next task is available, but the second screen behaves differently which convinced me to leave it for later.
